# Hydra Visuals

A collection of different visuals that I have created using [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra), a JavaScript-based web tool for creating synthesized visuals in your browser.

##### Getting Started

To use these visuals: 
- copy one of the scripts from this repository to your clipboard
- open the [Online Hydra Editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/)
- click the trash can at the top right of the screen to delete the current visual
- paste the script from your clipboard into the editor
- press the play button in the top right of the screen, or press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER
