# Hydra Visuals

A collection of different visuals that I have created using [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra), a JavaScript-based web tool for creating synthesized visuals. You can [use it in your browser](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/), download it as a [package with the Atom IDE](https://atom.io/packages/atom-hydra), or connect it to your own webpage with [the hydra-synth engine, via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydra-synth).

## Getting Started 

To use these visuals: 
- Copy one of the scripts from this repository to your clipboard
- Open the [Hydra Editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) in your browser (Chrome recommended)
- Click the trash can at the top right of the screen to delete the current visual
- Paste the script from your clipboard into the editor
- Press the play button in the top right of the screen, or press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER
- You can easily modify values and press the run button again to execute the code and create your own visuals
- Pressing CTRL+SHIFT+H will hide/show the code within the editor
